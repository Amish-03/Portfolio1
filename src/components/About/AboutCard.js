            Hi Everyone, I am <span className="purple">Amish </span>
            from <span className="purple">Hubballi, India.</span>
            <br />
            I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering at KLE Technological University.
            <br />
            I have a strong passion for Embedded Systems and Machine Learning, and Iâ€™m actively working on projects involving NVIDIA Jetson and real-time video processing.
            <br />
            <br />
            Apart from engineering, some other activities that I love to do:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li className="about-activity">
